# Courier App proposal for porter
I spend alot of time of social media and it is no news people are constantly seeking reliable courier services as there has been an exponential increase in small scale businesses. This is why for the past month, i thought it might be a good idea to work on this app

## Design
The software is of the parts:
- The client side app (For the clients to make orders)
- The courier app (For the riders)

### The client Side app
The client side app is quite straight forward with a user firendly interface that allow users to make to make orders and track the state of their delivery.
